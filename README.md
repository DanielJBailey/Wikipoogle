# Wikipoogle
This is a wikipedia search engine inspired by Google. My goal for this project was to replicate the responsiveness of google's search engine regardless of device used to view the application. I used Wikipedia's API to search for a query the user enters. Results are then displayed back to the user in the same format as google.
